# Crack Classification Project

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for a Deep Learning-based crack classification system. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately detect and classify surface anomalies in mechanical components, including crack, missing-head, and paint-off defects, using image data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and visual model testing with clear probability overlays. The system achieves strong classification performance and provides interpretable visual results for use in automated inspection settings.
